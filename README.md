Cyberspace enables direct communication and at the same time is an "Achilles heel" in
Security Issues. A Cyber Security specialist must understand the techniques and
organizational dimensions of this sector, to be able to recognize cyber threats and choose
and implement appropriate solutions.
Due to the socio-political diversity of the world's countries, cyber threats are dealt with differently. In particular, each country: (a) approaches issues related to cyber security from its own perspective, (b) has different tolerances in political and social
issues related to cyber security and (c) manages in its own way any actions
in cyberspace for political or ideological gain. Therefore, any organization that
wishes to expand its activities internationally must take these differences into account.
The Non-Profit Organization (NGO) DigTech is based in a European Union country and wishes to expand its activities in Hong Kong and the United States. Assume
that you have been invited by DigTech, as a Cyber Security Consultant, to give your opinion on a major cyber security issue, malware. In particular, your opinion was sought regarding the scope of this threat, as well as the potential and potential
restrictions that exist in these areas to deal with malware.
